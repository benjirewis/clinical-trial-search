      <p>The task of modeling clinical trial data can be effectively reduced to three basic subtasks: <strong>fetching</strong> data, <strong>reformatting</strong> data and <strong>modeling</strong> data.</p>

      <h2 id="fetching">Fetching</h2>

      <p>In the US, two databases represent the majority of virtually registered trials. These two are <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search">cancer.gov</a> run by the National Library of Medicine and the National Cancer Institute, respectively.</p>

      <p>Generally, the information we want about a trial can be reduced to:</p>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>General info</strong>: trial name, identification number (NCT id), location</li>

          <li><strong>"Structured" eligibility criteria</strong>: age range, gender group, conditions</li>

          <li><strong>"Unstructured" eligibility criteria</strong>: "has had no major surgery in the past month", "has lived in Peru for anywhere over a decade"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="clinicaltrialsgov">clinicaltrials.gov</h3>

      <p>275,512 studies registered / 47,219 active / 17,825 active in the US.</p>

      <p><a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a> has a fairly limited <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download">API</a></p>

      <p><em>Search parameters:</em><br>
          <code>term: generic search</code><br>
          <code>cond: targeted search for conditions</code><br>
          <code>intr: targeted search for interventions</code><br>
          <code>outc: targeted search for outcomes</code><br>
          <code>spons: targeted search for sponsors and collaborators</code><br>
          <code>recr: restricts search to 'open' or 'closed'</code></p>

      <p>To use download parameters, <code>download_fields?</code> must be included at the beginning of the request.</p>

      <p><em>Download parameters:</em><br>
          <code>down_count: 10, 100, 1000 or 10000</code><br>
          <code>down_flds: 'all' or 'default'</code><br>
          <code>down_fmt: 'plain', 'csv', 'tsv', 'xml', 'pdf'</code><br>
          <code>down_chunk: 1, 2, 3, ..., N</code></p>

      <p>Studies can be retrieved in plain text, CSV, TSV, XML or PDF format. By setting <code>down_flds=default</code>, Title, Status, Has Study Results, Conditions and Interventions are all downloaded.</p>

      <p><em>Example GET Requests:</em><br>
          <code>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results/download_fields?term=cancer&amp;down_count=10</code><br>Searches generically for cancer and retrieves the top 10 studies (in PDF format by default).<br>
          <code>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results/download_fields?cond=ptsd&amp;down_count=100&amp;down_fmt=plain&amp;down_chunk=2</code><br>Searches by condition for PTSD, retrieves results 100-200 (the second "chunk") in plain text format.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong> that there exist fields for general info and structured eligibility criteria retrieval, but unstructured criteria is not yet accessible through the API. <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a> does have support for <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-site/crawling">web-crawlers</a>, though. Criteria is also accessible through <a href="http://linkedct.org/">linkedct.org</a>, a semantic web data source for clinical trials, as well. Data on linkedct.org is fetched on a slightly irregular basis.</p>

      <h3 id="cancergov">cancer.gov</h3>

      <p>5,699 studies registered (this number changes frequently) / mostly US based.</p>

      <p>These are <em>all</em> oncological clinical trials and are drawn from the CTRP (clinical trials reporting program) database.</p>

      <p>In short, <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search">cancer.gov</a> has fewer studies with more standardized data. Features of the data include:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>standardized abstraction of protocol information</li>

          <li>consistent terminology and coding to optimize search and retrieval</li>

          <li>biomarker and patient-level accrual data</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="https://clinicaltrialsapi.cancer.gov/">API</a> is well maintained and flexible.</p>

      <p><em>Field parameters (the most useful ones)</em>:<br>
          <code>nct_id: search by National Clinical Trial identifier</code><br>
          <code>official_title_fulltext: search by title</code><br>
          <code>record_verification_date_gte: search by last update (yyyy-mm-dd)</code><br>
          <code>eligibility.structured.gender: gender restrictions</code><br>
          <code>eligibility.structured.min_age: minimum age restriction</code><br>
          <code>eligibility.structured.max_age: maximum age restriction</code><br>
          <code>eligibility.unstructured: unstructured eligibility criteria</code><br>
          <code>lat: the latitude in decimal degrees and plus/minus</code><br>
          <code>lon: the longitude in decimal degrees and plus/minus</code><br>
          <code>dist: the radius to search with in miles (2mi) or kilometers (5km)</code><br>
          <code>...</code></p>

      <p><em>Filter parameters</em>:<br>
          <code>size: limit results to a supplied amount (default 10, max 50)</code><br>
          <code>from: start results from a supplied starting point (default 0)</code><br>
          <code>include: include only the supplied field param in results</code><br>
          <code>exclude: exclude the supplied field param in results</code><br>
          <code>_fulltext: filter results by examining any text-based field param (as in &lt;field_param&gt;_fulltext)</code><br>
          <code>_trialids: filter results by examining trial identifiers (as &lt;trial_id&gt;_trialids)</code></p>

      <p>Responses to GET requests are always in JSON (with the following <a href="https://clinicaltrialsapi.cancer.gov/v1/clinical-trial.json">schema</a>).</p>

      <p><em>Example GET Requests</em>:<br>
          <code>http://clinical-trials?eligibility.structured.gender=female&amp;include=nct_id</code><br>Searches for female-only studies and returns only their NCT ids.<br>
          <code>http://clinical-trials?official_title_fulltext=breast&amp;20cancer&amp;include=nct_id&amp;include=official_title</code><br>Searches by appearance of "breast cancer" in official title and returns corresponding NCT ids and titles<br>
          <code>http://clinical-trials?_fulltext=hodgkin&amp;20lymphoma&amp;size=10&amp;exclude=sites</code><br>Searches by appearance of "hodgkin lymphoma" anywhere in study description, returns only top 10 results, and returns all information but sites (locations).</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong> that there exist fields for general info, structured eligibility criteria <em>and</em> unstructured eligibility criteria. For each unstructured criterion, there is a correlated "inclusion indicator" that seems to categorize into inclusion (pos. polarity) or exclusion (neg. polarity) with true or false respectively. For the time being there are seemingly no criteria with false inclusion indicator fields.</p>

      <h2 id="reformatting">Reformatting</h2>

      <p>Once the data has been fetched, it is often not viable for meaningful entry into any database. Usually, the just-fetched data is in some human-readable format (XML or JSON), but is not in the desired format for graph database entry.</p>

      <p>Graph databases stand in contrast with relational databases; they are collections of directly related items. For the use-case of clinical trial modeling, <em>trial items</em> need to have relations to some <em>requisite items</em>, so as to show that each trial has its own eligibility criteria. These <em>trial items</em> can be represented by the trial title or NCT id, and <em>requisite items</em> can be represented by age ranges, assumed medical conditions, gender groups and so on.</p>

      <p>Then, the trouble of reformatting can be plainly expressed as turning a relational model (where each trial has an entailing list of properties) into a graphical one (where each property of a trial is expressed as one relationship between <em>trial item</em> and <em>requisite item</em>).</p>

      <p>To fit the RDF (Resource Description Framework) model, we then need to turn some Markup Language file into one that can encode an RDF graph. The easiest and most flexible syntax is likely the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/">Turtle</a> one.</p>

      <p>Files would then be composed of triples (subject predicate object .) with trials as the subjects and features of the trial described with a predicate list. Features with multiple entries (requisite conditions, eligibility criteria) would be represented as object lists.<br><br>
          <code>BASE &lt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/&gt;</code><br>
          <code>PREFIX rel: &lt;http://www.dbpedia.org/property/&gt;</code><br>
          <code>PREFIX rdf: &lt;https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#&gt;</code><br><br>
          <code>&lt;NCT520501203924&gt;</code><br>
          <code><tab>rel:title “Audio-Chemical Therapy for Reduction of Neoplasms” ;</tab></code><br>
          <code><tab>rel:min_age “18” ;</tab></code><br>
          <code><tab>rel:max_age “99” ;</tab></code><br>
          <code><tab>rel:gender “Female” ;</tab></code><br>
          <code><tab>rel:condition “Breast Cancer”, "Malignant Neoplasm" ;</tab></code><br>
          <code><tab>rel:criteria “over 100 pounds”, "originally from a third world country" ;</tab></code><br>
          <code><tab>rdf:type "Clinical Trial" .</tab></code></p>

      <p>The last <code>rdf:type</code> relation specifies the subject <code>NCT520501203924</code> is a trial as distinct from a patient.

      <p>This reformatting could be done with the use of a so-called <strong>"data-wrangler"</strong> or with <strong>scripting</strong>:</p>

      <h3 id="datawranglingwithknime">Data-wrangling with KNIME</h3>

      <p><img src="https://files.knime.com/themes/custom/bootstrap_knime/logo.svg" alt="KNIME Logo" style="width:200px;height:70px;"/><br>KNIME stands for KoNstanz Information MinEr and is pronounced [naim].</p>

      <p>Officially, it is a free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform. Unofficially, it is a data-wrangler; KNIME offers the ability to create workflows: assemblies of nodes that can blend different data sources for the purposes of modeling, analysis and reformatting.</p>

      <p>The major benefit of a data-wrangler like KNIME is the option of minimal programming. The KNIME GUI is self-explanatory, powerful and customizable. Custom coding and interfacing with a mixture of structured and unstructured data can be overly complicated.</p>

      <p>However, KNIME is not very portable. Workflows cannot be significantly compressed, and are often larger and slightly slower than their custom-coded counterparts. Running a workflow externally also requires a large list of source files to be present (about one gigabyte).</p>

      <p>Ideally, a KNIME workflow could be extended to a KNIME <a href="https://www.knime.com/knime-server">server</a>. That way, collaboration, deployment and management would be feasible and accessible.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong> that KNIME servers come in three payment models, with REST API and node encryption available online in the higher payment plans.</p>

      <h3 id="reformattingwithpython">Reformatting with Python</h3>

      <p><img src="https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-generic.svg" alt="Python Logo" style="width:200px;height:70px;"/><br>Python, here, is standing in for any scripting language.</p>

      <p>Reformatting data, especially with structures like JSON and XML, is well-supported in Python, though. Python's 'json' module supports JSON to dictionary conversion, and processing can be done from there. An 'xml' package is natively included in version 2.7.15, as well.</p>

      <p>Python parsing and reformatting programs are certainly more lightweight than data-wrangler workflows. They execute faster (especially on large files), and they need few source files.</p>

      <p>However, these programs are not easily customizable especially when transferring users. Having a viewable workflow means that nearly anyone can add features or remove bugs quickly.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong> that unstructured eligibility criteria obviously needs separate processing. The natural language contained in these sections should be reduced to some standardized ontology (ideally <a href="https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search">MeSH</a>). Reduced traits could be treated as any other <em>requisite item</em>. Reduction of clinical natural language is not unprecedented; below are hyperlinks to related papers and tools.</p>

      <h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>

      <p>No matter the chosen format, any model must portray meaningful information relative to both clinical trials <em>and</em> candidate patients. In the case of a graph database, this means there should probably be nodes or "subjects" for both trials and patients.</p>

      <p>Patients, then, would appear encoded in ttl-format as well:<br><br>
        <code>BASE &lt;https://alohahealth.net/users/&gt;</code><br><br>
        <code>&lt;jdoe&gt;</code><br>
        <code><tab>rel:full_name “Jane Doe” ;</tab></code><br>
        <code><tab>rel:age “65” ;</tab></code><br>
        <code><tab>rel:gender “Female” ;</tab></code><br>
        <code><tab>rel:condition “PTSD”, "Anxiety Disorder" ;</tab></code><br>
        <code><tab>rel:trait “served in the Army”, "over 100 pounds" ;</tab></code><br>
        <code><tab>rdf:type "Patient" .</tab></code></p>

      <p>The <code>rel:trait</code> relation would be phenotypes extracted from EMRs (electronic medical records) using natural language processing. The last <code>rdf:type</code> relation implies that <code>jdoe</code> is a patient as distinct from a clinical trial.</p>

      <p>Advocacy networks could even be encoded similarly:<br><br>
          <code>BASE &lt;https://alohahealth.net/advocacies/&gt;</code><br><br>
          <code>&lt;cancercommons&gt;</code><br>
          <code><tab>rel:full_name “Cancer Commons Nonprofit Network” ;</tab></code><br>
          <code><tab>rel:condition “Breast Cancer”, "Prostate Cancer", "Cancer", "Neoplasm" ;</tab></code><br>
          <code><tab>rdf:type "Advocacy" .</tab></code></p>

      <p>In this model, the most meaningful edges would be those between patients and trials. These edges would indicate a patient might be a good candidate for a trial, and they could be drawn based on the number of shared edges between the patient and trial in question.</p>
